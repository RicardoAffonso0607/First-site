# YouTube Recreation

## First project using HTML and CSS

This project is a recreation of the YouTube main page using HTML and CSS. I aimed to replicate the look and feel of the YouTube homepage to practice my front-end development skills. The project includes the header, search bar, and a few videos, closely resembling the original design.

## Features

- HTML and CSS only: The entire project is built using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling.
- Responsive Design: The page is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
- Use of hover and transitions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RicardoAffonso0607/Youtube-Recreation.git`
2. Open the `youtube.html` file in your web browser.
